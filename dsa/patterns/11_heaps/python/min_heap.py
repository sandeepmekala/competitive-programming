-> It is a complete Binary Tree
-> Heap can be min heap or max heap
-> In min heap, root is minimum among all nodes
-> Usually built using array
-> Parent of element a[i] is at a[(i-1)//2]
-> Left child of element a[i] is at a[2*i+1]
-> Right child of element a[i] is at a[2*i+2]
-> heapq in Python implements a min heap by default
